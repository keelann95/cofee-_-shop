 ## Core deliverables


For this assignment, we'll be working with a Coffee shop-style domain.

We have three models: Coffee, Customer, and Order.

For our purposes, a Coffee has many Orders, a Customer has many Orders, and an Order belongs to a Customer and to a Coffee.

Coffee - Customer is a many-to-many relationship.

Note: You should draw your domain on paper or on a whiteboard before you start coding. Remember to identify a single source of truth for your data.
